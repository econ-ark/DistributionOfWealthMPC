# ### TO DO:
#
# - All of the text can be edited and rewritten
# - Add links/citations
# - Check on the empirical targets, both in the CSTW paper/code/repo and recent measurements from the literature
# - Find a way to produce graphical versions of the empirical results from the four papers on "measuring heterogeneity in the rate of return"
# - Think more on other ways to compare the results of the notebook to the empirical results of the four papers
#
# - learn more about other possible distributional assumptions for the rate of return (with skewness and kurtosis) that are similar to the empirical data on the rate of return. See economics literature on distributional assumptions on the rate of return...
#     - look for more papers that attempt to measure the rate of return to assets (consumer finance literature?)
# - estimate the life-cycle version of the model (for the uniform and lognormal distribution as well... and potentially the distribution that I find in the literature)

# # The Distribution of Wealth and the MPC

# %% [markdown]
# This notebook presents an analogous selection of results from the paper [The Distribution of Wealth and the Marginal Propensity to Consume](http://econ.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/cstwMPC), using the [Econ-ARK/HARK](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK) toolkit. In this version of the model, the results are presented for the estimation procedure with the **rate of return** as the key parameter of interest.

# ## Contributions from the CSTW paper
#
# ### Heterogeneous Time Preferences
#
# In a model calibrated to match micro- and macroeconomic evidence on household income dynamics, (cite the CSTW paper) shows that a modest degree of heterogeneity in household preferences or beliefs is sufficient to match empirical measures of wealth inequality in the U.S. 
#
# In cstwMPC, the authors calibrated nearly all of the model parameters-- risk aversion, income shock process, etc-- to commonly used or previously estimated values.  The only parameter to be estimated is the distribution of $\beta$.  cstwMPC assumed that $\beta$ is uniformly distributed on $[\grave{\beta}-\nabla,\grave{\beta}+\nabla]$, approximated by a seven point distribution.
#
# ### Empirical Wealth Targets
#
# Their estimation procedure seeks the values of $\grave{\beta}$ and $\nabla$ that generate a simulated distribution of wealth that best matches empirical U.S. data.  Their definition of "best match" has two aspects:
#
# 1. The simulated aggregate capital-to-income ratio matches the true U.S. value.
# 2. The sum of squared distances between the simulated and empirical Lorenz curves (at the 20th, 40th, 60th, and 80th percentiles) is minimized (conditional on item 1).
#
# cstwMPC's target empirical moments are a capital-to-income ratio of 10.26 and cumulative wealth shares as given in the table below.  Yes, you are reading the table correctly: The "poorest" 80 percent of households own 17.5 percent of wealth.
#
# | Net worth percentile | Cumulative wealth share |
# |:---:|:---:|
# |  20th  | -0.2% |
# |  40th  | 1.0% |
# |  60th  | 5.5% |
# |  80th  | 17.5% |
#
# For a description of the relevant notation and the optimization problem that households solve, see (Link to the CSTW notebook). Importantly, the estimation procedure in this paper will use the same empirical targets as those presented there.

# ## Heterogeneous Rates of Return
#
# ### Theoretical Motivation 
#
# As discussed in the DemARK (link to Micro-and-Macro-Implications...), Buffer stock saving models of the kind implemented in $\texttt{ConsIndShockType}$ say that, if a standard ['Growth Impatience Condition'](https://econ-ark.github.io/BufferStockTheory/#GICRaw), holds:
#
# \begin{eqnarray}
# \newcommand{\Rfree}{\mathsf{R}}\newcommand{\DiscFac}{\beta}\newcommand{\PermGroFac}{\Gamma}\newcommand{\PermShk}{\psi}\newcommand{\CRRA}{\rho}
# \left(\frac{(\Rfree\DiscFac)^{1/\CRRA}\mathbb{E}[\PermShk^{-1}]}{\PermGroFac}\right) & < & 1
# \end{eqnarray}
#
# then the _ratio_ of asets $\newcommand{\aLev}{\mathbf{a}}\aLev$ to permanent income $\newcommand{\pLev}{\mathbf{p}}\pLev$, $a=\aLev/\pLev$, has a target value $\newcommand{\aTarg}{\check{a}}\aTarg$ that depends on the consumer's preferences (relative risk aversion $\CRRA$, time preference $\DiscFac$) and circumstances (interest factor $\Rfree$, growth factor $\PermGroFac$, uncertainty about permanent income shocks $\sigma^{2}_{\PermShk}$).
#
# If everyone had identical preferences and everyone were at their target $\check{a}$, then inequality in the level of $\aLev$ would be exactly the same as inequality in $\pLev$. 
#
# Moreover, since each of the parameters featured in this Growth Impatience Condition capture aspects of the household's optimal consumption-savings behavior, the assumption that households differ significantly in the value of one or many of these variables can potentially explain disparities in wealth accumulation over the life-cycle.
#
# ### Empirical Evidence 
#
# It is worth noting that the time preference factor $(\beta)$ is one of the key parameters that influences an individual's equilibrium target level of market resources, but it is not directly observable. Therefore, in order to estimate $\beta$, one would need to gather data through surveys or other methods that allow for the direct acquisition of information from households.
#
# On the other hand, estimating differences in the rate of return $(\Rfree)$ to financial assets across households is possible, as this variable *is* directly observable. Recent empirical recent has exploited the usefulness novel, administrative and survey datasets on household asset holdings in an attempt to quantify the differences in returns among individuals. These datasets are "novel" in the sense that they are more representative of household finances than their U.S. counterparts, which are known to suffer from substantial measurement bias, especially at the top end of the wealth distribution. 
#
# Among these recent empirical efforts are the following notable contributions (provide actual citation/links for each of these):
#
# 1. Do the Rich Get Richer in the Stock Market? Evidence from India
# 2. Financial Literacy and Savings Account Returns
# 3. Rich Pickings? Risk, Return, and Skill in Household Wealth
# 4. Heterogeneity and Persistence in Returns to Wealth
#
# Not only do each of these papers provide motivation for the estimation of a buffer-stock savings model with ex-ante heterogeneity in the rate of return, but they also offer a baseline for evaluating the results of the procedure. That is, the distribution of rates of return which are produced in this notebook should be "close" to the empirical estimates presented in these papers.
#
# *In this notebook, the notion of "closeness" will be a graphical comparison. However, it is clear that a more mathematical description can be presented (much as the distance between the simulated and empirical Lorenz points are minimized).* (-revise this, could be said much better!)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Goals of this Notebook
#
# * Run the simplest specification of the estimation for Rfree
# * Compare the results to CSTW... how "close" are the Lorenz sim points to the empirical counterpart?
# * Compare the estimated distribution of Rfree to the "empirical counterpart" regarding heterogeneous returns, from the four empirical papers listed above

# ## Return Preference Heterogeneneity
#
# The analog to the CSTW (link to paper/notebook) work is referred to as the $\Rfree$-Dist model. Here, households no longer have the same rate of return to their assets. Instead, the model assumes that, for some dispersion $\nabla$, the rate of return to assets are distributed uniformly in the population between
# $\grave{\Rfree}-\nabla$ and $\grave{\Rfree}+\nabla$. 
#
# From here, using simulations, we search for the values of $\grave{\Rfree}$ and
# $\nabla$ for which the model best matches the fraction of net worth held by the top $20$, $40$, $60$, and $80$ percent of the population, while at the same time matching
# the aggregate capital-to-output ratio from the perfect foresight
# model. For a description of the optimization problem that describes this structural estimation procedure, see (Link to the CSTW notebook). 
#
# The solution to this problem assuming ex-ante heterogeneity in the rate of return is $\{\grave{\Rfree}, \nabla\}=\{1.03218, 0.01332\}$, so that the rate of return to assets is evenly spread roughly between 1.0189 and 1.0455.
#
# Thus, much like the model with time preference heterogeneity, the introduction of even such a relatively modest amount of heterogeneity in the rate of return to assets sharply improves the model's fit to the targeted
# proportions of wealth holdings, bringing it reasonably in line with the data. 
#
# In fact, the fit here is better than the analogous, estimation under the simplest specification of the model with heterogeneous time preferences: the *Lorenz distance* in that model is $4.75$, while here it is $2.07$.

# ## Life-cycle version of the model
#
# We are interested in comparing the estimated distribution of the rate of return across households to measurements of its empirical counterpart. To be sure that the two objects of interest are comparable, we reestimate the life-cycle version of the model. It should be the case that a wider distribution of return is needed to match the empirical wealth targets, since wealth cannot grow without bounds under the assumption of a finite lifetime for households.

# ### Possible distributional assumptions for the rate of return
#
# * Pareto
# * Weibull
# * Beta
#
#     * Lognormal
#     * Exponential
#
# Note, so far, only the Pareto distribution has been cited as a possible candidate of the distribution of returns.
#
# Although a typical assumption is that returns are lognormally distributed, based on the data from Fagereng et al., a negative skewness suggests that the lognormal distribution may not be the correct asssumption (much like the uniform distribution may not be correct due to it exhibiting a skewnesss value of 0). Lastly, although exponential distirbution seemed like a possible candidate due to its shape when comparing it to a graph of the data on the rate of return to safe assets from Fagereng et al., has constant, positive values of skewness and kurtosis.
